## Bug


monday 21st feb
JS code to show random phrase from string is showing undefined instead of daata from the string (could be a simple spelling/syntax error)

fix "simple syntax erroe forgot to put = after const before string of lines "


issue i am having is figuring out how to link the current level and the diffrent level buttons 
I am thinking an if statement ( if easy clicked set level to easy ) or (on mouse click set current level to event ? )
